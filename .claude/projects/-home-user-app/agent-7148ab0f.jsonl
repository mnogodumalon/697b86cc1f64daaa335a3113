I understand that I'm working with a React Dashboard Generator for Living Apps Backend, and I can see the clear workflow:\n\n1. **Design First** (using frontend-design skill)\n2. **Then Implement** (using frontend-impl skill)\n3. **Build & Deploy**\n\nI also note the critical technical constraints:\n- Special date format requirements for Living Apps API\n- Proper handling of applookup fields using `extractRecordId()`\n- API returns objects, not arrays\n- TypeScript import type conventions\n- shadcn Select component gotchas\n\n**Key Point:** I'm in **READ-ONLY planning mode** right now. I can explore the codebase and create implementation plans, but I cannot create or modify any files during this phase.\n\nI'm ready to help! What would you like me to work on?
